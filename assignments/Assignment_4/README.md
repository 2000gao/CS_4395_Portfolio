## How to run the programs
Have the `data` folder in the same directory as `program1.py` and `program2.py`. For example, your current directory should have `data/...`, `program1.py`, `program2.py`.


The repository contains the pickle files from `program1.py`, but you can choose to generate your own pickle files by
running `program1.py`. Once the `.p` files are generated for each language, run `program2.py`, generating an output file with the predicted language for each line in `LangId.test`, and outputting the accuracy to console.
