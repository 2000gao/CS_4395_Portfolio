## How to run
Run webcrawler.py in an IDE. It will output `urls.txt`, 15 url scraped files from `url1.txt` to `url15.txt`, and a pickled file `knowledge_base_dict.p` containing a dictionary of 10 terms as keys and a list of sentences as values.

Included in this repository will be files generated from my working run. If an error occurs when running the program, you can instead use the provided files.
